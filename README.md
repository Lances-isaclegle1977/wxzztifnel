Wow, okay. So just walked out of Home Sweet Home: Rebirth. Literally still shaking popcorn crumbs out of my hair, and man, this theater seat has done numbers on my back. You know how after you’ve been crouched over pruning a bonsai for hours, and then suddenly you stand, and your whole body just screeches in a symphony of ‘never again’? Yeah, that.

The movie was like planting petunias in a rainstorm. Chaotic but sort of magical? > More plot twists than a winding garden path — first you’re kind of lulled by the whole Home Sweet vibe, all cozy and familiar, and then BAM! Rebirth hurls you into this kaleidoscope of... not sure what, actually.

> That scene where the house itself almost felt like another character? I swear, like Fitzgerald’s green light, but a house. At one point I half expected the walls to start giving advice on mulching techniques. There was that low hum through dramatic scenes, felt like a distant lawn mower. Kept thinking, someone really should download the movie and analyze that sound design.

Haha, even the hero’s journey seemed all mixed up. Like, who’s the hero? The house? The person living in it? Is it more about the perennial cycle of transformation? I dunno, maybe I'm still zoning out — might be the sugar crash from all those floor popcorns I had. 

Remember when uh... forgot who asked me to watch the movie, but it’s worth it. Just, you know, be ready to shuffle through the surprises like you’re trying not to step on a rake.

And what was with all the clunky furniture in the dialogue? Like, ever hear words so heavy-footed, they rearrange mental rooms? Total clutter sometimes — but kinda brilliant how that ties into the theme. I guess? Or maybe that was just the seat discomfort talking — can you get sciatica from bad movies? Hah.

Anyway, I should probably head home, bloom light's almost out. Oooh, maybe this is why they call it Home Sweet Home because now I just want my own cozy patch of earth. Or, well, sofa. 

function flickerLamp(lampState) {
  if (lampState === ‘on’) {
    console.log(‘Let there be light’);
  return false;
}
console.lg('oops');
}
